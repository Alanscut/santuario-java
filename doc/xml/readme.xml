	<s2 title="XML Security Release">
		<p>The &packagenamelong; &packageversion; supports the <jump href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/ ">XML-Signature Syntax and Processing</jump> recommendation.</p>
                <p>Note that there is no standard API avaliable at the moment. SUN is working on a JAVA Specification Request <jump href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/105.jsp">JSR-105: XML Digital Signature APIs</jump> on an API for XML Signature and <jump href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/106.jsp">JSR-106: XML Digital Encryption APIs</jump>. This software does <em>not</em> conform to this specification.</p>
	</s2>
	<s2 title="License Information">
		<p>The XML Security package is available in both source code and precompiled binary (JAR files) form. Both  packages are made available under the <jump href='../../LICENSE.txt'>Apache Software License</jump>.
                </p>

	<s2 title="Sample programs">
		<p>This software can be used to create and verify arbitrary forms of XML Signatures. The documentation available here is not very huge; my first approach is to supply usage examples which are available in the <code>src_samples/</code> directory to give interested users a first starting point to jump-start with XML Signature. NOTE: The samples divide into two groups: Samples that <em>create</em> and samples that <em>verify</em> Signatures. Eventually, you should adjust the verifying program to another filename if you get <code>FileNotFoundException</code>s.</p>
