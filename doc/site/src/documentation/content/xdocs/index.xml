          Version 1.00 of the C++ library is now released.  This is the first
          stable release of the library.  Functionality is still fairly basic,
          but all mandatory parts of the the DSIG standard are fully 
          implemented.

      <title>The Project</title>
      <p>
        The XML Security project is aimed at providing implementation of
        security standards for XML.  Currently the focus is on the W3C
        standards :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><jump href="http://www.w3.org/Signature/">
            XML-Signature Syntax and Processing; and</jump>
        </li>
        <li><jump href="http://www.w3.org/Encryption/2001/">
            XML Encryption Syntax and Processing.</jump></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once these are implemented, 
        <jump href="http://www.w3.org/2001/XKMS">XML Key Management</jump>
          is likely to be the next focus for the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two libraries are currently available.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A Java library, which includes a mature Digital Signature 
          implementation.  Encryption is currently under development.</li>
        <li>A C++ library is also now available.  Currently this is in
          beta and supports Digital Signature processing only.</li>
      </ol>
