	  <question>
		Is OpenSSL required?
      </question>
      <answer>
		<p>
		  The main development work for the library is done using OpenSSL, so
		  this is the recommended option.  However, a developmental Windows
		  Crypto API interface is also now provided.
		</p>
		<p>
		  It is also possible to implement interfaces for other cryptographic
		  libraries and pass them into the xml-security-c library during
		  initialisation (via the <em>XSECPlatformUtils::Initialise()</em>
		  call).

	  <question>
		Does the library provide a full C++ wrapper for OpenSSL?
	  </question>
	  <answer>
		<p>
		  The C++ crypto interface layer provided for the library provides only
		  the smallest subset of cryptographic functions necessary for the
		  library to make calls to the provided library.  Applications will
		  need to work directly with OpenSSL (or other libraries) to read and
		  manipulate encryption keys that should then be wrapped in XSECCrypto*
		  objects and passed into the library.

	<faq id="wincapi_c">
	  <question>
		What is WinCAPI?
	  </question>
	  <answer>
		<p>
		  WinCAPI is the developmental interface being built to give
		  users of the library access to the Windows Cryptographic library.
		</p>
		<p>
		  It is <em>not</em> a C API wrapper for the overall library.

    <faq id="xalan_c">
      <question>
		Is Xalan required?
      </question>
      <answer>
		<p>
		  The library can be compiled without linking to Xalan-c.  However
		  doing so will disable support for XPath and XSLT transformations.
		</p>
		<p>
		  To disable Xalan-c support either use --without-xalan when running
		  configure on UNIX, or use the VC++ "without Xalan" settings.
