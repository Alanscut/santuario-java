		Beta 0.2 has been released.  It covers :
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>some minor bug-fixes in the	code and the UNIX build system</li>
		<li>a first cut at a Windows Crypto API provider interface</li>
		<li>methods to extract information from signature objects; and</li>
		<li>updates to tools to allow (and demonstrate) use of Windows CAPI
		  and new extraction methods</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
		Beta 0.2 is has been tested with Xerces-C v2.2 and the newly 
		released Xalan-C v1.5.

      <title>Overview of the C++ Library</title>
      <p>
        The C++ library is an implementation of the XML Digital Signature
        specification.  It is designed to be easily ported to new platforms,
        and has been tested on Solaris, Linux and Windows.  The next version
        will have ports to FreeBSD and HP-UX.
      </p>
      <p>
        The library makes use of the Apache XML project's Xerces-C XML Parser
        and Xalan-C XSLT processor.  The latter is used for processing XPath
        and XSLT transforms.  The use of Xalan-C is optional, but without it,
        XPath and XSLT transformations cannot be performed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the library currently uses OpenSSL to provide 
        cryptographic functionality.  The cryptographic interface is
        implemented via a thin wrapper layer, which will be expanded to
        support the GNU Privacy Guard cryptographic library (libgcrypt) and
        Windows CAPI in the near future.
      </p>

		<p>
		  The C++ library has now been fully transferred into the Apache XML
		  project.  It was previously hosted on SourceForge.
		</p>
		<p>
		  The first release under Apache is 0.10.  This is a Beta release,
		  with fairly complete documentation, and a stable code base.  It
		  fully validates the various interop documents held in the xml-security
		  CVS, with the exception of those related to :
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>MD5 Digests (to be added in next point release)</li>
		  <li>XPath Filter (to be added in next point release)</li>
		  <li>XML Encryption (to be added post 1.00 release)</li>
		</ul>
